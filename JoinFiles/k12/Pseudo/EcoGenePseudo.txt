B7L4V9 is 505 aa and starts at an ATG 4 codons upstream, but this upstream start codon has no RBS associated with it. The C-terminal domain of full-length YzgL belongs to the PstS superfamily of solute binding domains found in both periplasmic binding proteins and in LysR family transcriptional regulators. The N-terminal domain of full-length YzgL has no CDD hits with E values < 0.01, but the two best hits suggest that the N-terminal domain is not a DNA-binding domain, but rather the permease component of a transport system, possibly an ion transporter. These CDD (at NCBI) hits are to (1) COG2998 (TupB), weakly predicting (E = 0.02) that this domain is related to the permease component of an ABC-type tungstate transport system, and (2) COG3263, weakly predicting (E = 0.10) that this domain is related to NhaP-type Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporters. Full-length YzgL may be  a hydrid transporter with an N-terminal integral membrane domain and a C-terminal periplasmic solute-binding domain. Consistent with this interpretation, TMHMM predicts five transmembrane segments (TMs) in the first 203 residues and no TMs in the C-terminal 300 residues, whci is predicted by TMHMM to be outside (periplasmic). Signal-P HMM predicts a 22 signal peptide, but this may be a false positive due to an N-terminal transmembrane region. The yzgL' pseudogene is preceded by a putative attenuator structure."	8044.09
